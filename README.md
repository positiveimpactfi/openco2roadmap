# Open CO2 roadmap

This is an open source carbon footprint calculator project created by [Positive Impact](https://www.positiveimpact.fi). The first release of the project in September 2021 was made for the [Regional Council of Lapland](https://www.lapinliitto.fi/en/), and funded by [European Regional Development fund (ERDF)](http://www.rakennerahastot.fi/web/en).

The calculator is initially designed to serve small and medium size companies in the travel industry in Finland. This is reflected both in the calculator boundary and emission factor library.
